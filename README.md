**ABSTRACT**
Wasting food is a common problem in our society. This Project aims to 
reduce food wastage and built an android mobile application that allows 
individual users or restaurants to donate and share their foods and leftovers with 
people in need.
Many restaurants tend to throw the leftover food at the end of the day 
even though the food is perfectly fine to be eaten, some families can barely 
afford proper meals with their limited money. Therefore, we decided to create 
our application to link the restaurant with the unfortunate people, so instead of 
throwing the food, the unfortunate will be able to pick it up from the restaurant 
at the end of the day.
• My application have many types of donating users either from 
organizations such as restaurants, or a family or a single user
• Location facility also there, donating user should specify the location 
of the shared food.
• Adding the time and date of each meal shared by users

**Decription**
Food waste is a significant issue that has environmental, economic, and 
social implications. On one hand, large quantities of perfectly edible food are 
discarded daily by households, restaurants, and other food establishments. On the 
other hand, many people are struggling with food insecurity and hunger, unable 
to access sufficient nutritious food for themselves and their families. To address 
this imbalance, we have developed a mobile application called the Food Waste 
Management System. The Food Waste Management System aims to bridge the 
gap between food surplus and food scarcity by facilitating the donation and 
distribution of excess food. The application is designed to connect donors, such 
as individuals and restaurants, with recipients, including NGOs and charities that 
provide food to those in need.
Our app leverages mobile technology to create a user-friendly platform that 
simplifies the process of food donation and distribution. By making it easier to 
donate excess food and ensuring that it reaches those in need, the Food Waste 
Management System helps reduce food waste and support food-insecure 
populations. Future enhancements to the app could include extending support to 
multiple platforms, integrating geolocation features to help donors and recipients 
find each other more easily, and incorporating user feedback mechanisms to 
continually improve the service. These additions will make the system more 
robust and accessible to a broader audience.
In summary, the Food Waste Management System is a practical and 
innovative solution to the problem of food waste. By connecting donors with 
those in need, the app not only helps reduce the environmental impact of food 
waste but also supports vulnerable populations, contributing to a more sustainable 
and equitable community.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, the Food Wastage Reduction Application stands as a 
promising solution to the pressing issues of food waste and food insecurity. Its 
success highlights the power of technology in creating sustainable and equitable 
food systems. Continued development, addressing challenges, and scaling the 
app's reach can further enhance its impact, contributing significantly to 
environmental sustainability and social welfare.
